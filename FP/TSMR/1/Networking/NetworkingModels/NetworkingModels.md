# Networking Models
The way information is transmitted in a network is usually by preparing that information using "steps".
These steps are called encapsulation since the information is 
There are 2 widely recognized models for how networks implementations work.
- [OSI model](OSI.md): Used for theory representation not used in real networks.
- [TCP/IP model](TCP-IP.md): Used by almost if not all networks, similar (for some simplified) to the OSI model.
These models work in "layers" in which information passes through, being encapsulated in different way to match different [standards and protocols](../StandardsAndProtocols/StandardsAndProtocols.md).
