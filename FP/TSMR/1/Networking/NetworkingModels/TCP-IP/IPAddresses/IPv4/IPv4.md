# IPv4
IPv4 addresses are composed of 32 bits divided in 4 sections called "octets" of 8 bits each.
In decimal format, each octet can go for 0 to 255 (In hexadecimal from 0 to FF).

In today's age IPv4 addresses are a scarse resource due to the number of devices and networks that are interconnected today, for this type of problem, [IPv6](IPv6.md) and [NAT](NAT.md)+[PAT](PAT.md) come to play to either resolve or appease the problem.
