# DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name Service)
DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name Service) takes the basic concept of DNS and adds the possibility to dynamically request changes to the Domain registers, usually secured using API keys and dedicated clients.

This helps with dynamic IP allocation and assignation done by common household ISPs like Vodafone, Orange, Verizon, AT&T, Movistar, etc.

A common example is the Cloudflare DDNS service.
