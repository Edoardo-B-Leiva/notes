# SSH Servers
Today there isn't much software made for SSH serving.
The most common and used by far is [**OpenSSH**](https://www.openssh.org), which is part of the greater [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) project, for this reason, it will be written directly in this page and not in a dedicated one.
