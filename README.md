This github repo comes from:
- Needing:
  - To make some school annotations accessible to some specific people;
  - To improve on my skills
- Wanting:
  - To make my school notes "open-source";
  - To get familiarized with Git, Github and Markdown.

Most, if not all files in this repo will be markdown files redacting the topic dictated by the filename.
The file structure is made up by:
```
/root
    |_Study Level
        |_Course
            |_Year
                |_Subject
