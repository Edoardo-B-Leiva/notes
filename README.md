This repository contains notes I will be taking throughout my studying journey.
Any ongoing note-taking will have it's own branch based on the subject until it's finished, in which case the branch will be merged to the main branch.
All notes will be taken in English but subject names may be in the Language I've taken them and may be translated later on (for my comodity).
